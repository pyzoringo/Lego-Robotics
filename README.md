# Lego-Robotics
Setting up procedure, required files @ http://www.mindstorms.rwth-aachen.de/  

The goal of this project is to set up a Lab session for a Robotic lecture.  Students need to build a 2-axis system robotic arm, and command the arm to cruise following a designated track.  
What I put here are several self-made functions to help calculation and basic movement  
Most file, including Lego library is stored elsewhere. Here is a place to show final outcome
